## Briefly about myself:
I began my career as a test automation engineer, specializing in developing UI tests for web browsers. I am a reliable and highly organized team player with a strong desire to advance my career in IT. My goal is to transition into a Developer role where I can leverage my technical skills to own the full development lifecycle. I aim to take informal business requirements ("napkin-sketched ideas") and orchestrate their complete implementation – from specification through development, CI/CD pipeline integration, and metric-driven monitoring – all the way to production release.
